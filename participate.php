			There are many ways to be a part of the development of the largest open POI database...
			<h2>Join the discussion</h2>
			<p>There are two mailing lists related to OpenPOIs development. <a href="https://lists.opengeospatial.org/mailman/listinfo/OpenPOIs-users">OpenPOIs-users@lists.opengeospatial.org</a> is a group of people interested in improving the data and/or code in the system, or connecting POI systems together. <a href="https://lists.opengeospatial.org/mailman/listinfo/OpenPOIdb-announce">OpenPOIdb-announce@lists.opengeospatial.org</a> is for those who just want to know about major events in the evolution of OpenPOIs.</p>
			<p>There is also a mailing list devoted to the development of the POI format, which is governed by an official OGC standards working group (the POI SWG). All individuals who want to be on the POI SWG mailing list will need to sign the same Observer Agreement that members of the OGC OpenPOI Standards Working Group must sign. This OGC Standards Working Group policy is necessary in order to ensure that all OGC standards remain Reasonable And Non-Discriminatory and Royalty-Free (RAND-RF) for the good of everyone. Download the agreement here [LINK], then sign it and return it via fax, mail or emailed scanned image. Include your email address. We will then then email you your initial POI SWG username and password.</p>

			<h2>Edit POI listings by hand</h2>
			Add your own tags and descriptions on any POI listing by signing in on any POI page (click the "Sign in" button in the top right corner). After signing in you should notice that you now see pencil icons above the descriptions and tags. Click on the pencil and add tags or descriptive paragraphs.
